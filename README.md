IOS application for time measurment of breast feeding sessions. It allowed tracking date/time/side.

The application existed in two version paid/free. The paid version had additinal night theme and history features.

The project did't generate enough money to cover maintanance and feature development. That was the reason I pulled it off from the App Store.
